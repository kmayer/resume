## I am seeking a senior technical leadership position

You have product that is getting some traction and your engineering team is growing. Some of the challenges you might be facing, right now, are scaling the team. You need to pivot, fast, to the changing market. You'd like to get better at agile practices and ensure that you'll continue to hire engineers that will fit with your current team.


## Pivotal Labs
### Engineering Manager, August 2010-Present

As a manager, I coach engineers to achieve the "next level" of performance, especially leadership skills, (most "pivots" are self-motivated technically). By the end of their first year, each one is capable of acting as a team leader, working closely with the client, designers, and other stake holders on a project. I foster a culture of continuous feedback so corrections are small, and few surprises during our reviews. I work with my reports to identify and cultivate goals that are deeply personal to them. All of these are geared toward increasing value and reducing turnover.
