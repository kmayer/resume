## I am actively seeking a senior technical leadership position; VP Engineering.

A great fit: Your company has closed or is about to close significant funding. You have a brilliant engineering team, probably a CTO, and a product that is getting some traction. The trouble is that your, once small, band of brothers team is getting too big to manage (by themselves or the founders). You've encountered some pain points already: It is getting harder to pivot changes to your product. You're worried about your bus count, hiring is becoming more challenging, and you're concerned that you can't find another brilliant engineer that will fit with your team. You like "Agile," maybe you're even using Scrum. You're not sure how to make it work, or is it even worth the effort.

Unique things that I bring to the table:

I am still a great engineer (currently 35-40 hours per week, while maintaining manager duties). During the early stages, I can still code for you. This has the added advantage, for me, to learn your codebase and meet your team. Will I ever be your brilliant shining star innovator? Probably not. That's not what I'm good at. But I can help them stay focused on the most important thing.

I have a hiring technique that is incredibly effective and efficient. I can screen a candidate in under an hour, and make a hiring decision in 1 work day. I've had zero failures. I do not use code-on-the-white-board tests, instead, I sit down with a candidate and pair-program on a real problem.

I have a large collection of tools and techniques for delivering reliable code that is focused on business needs.

I train & mentor developers; I believe that it benefits everyone if they increase their skill set and improve overall bus count.

Caveats

I'm not obsessed with the title. In a larger organization, I'd fit well as a Director reporting to an existing VP.

# Pivotal Labs
## Engineering Manager
> August 2010 â€“ Present

Senior level full-stack engineer (I still code 90% of the time): From green field to legacy rescues. I have a deep understanding of the underlying technologies, so libraries such as AREL is not a mysterious SQL machine. I speak SMTP from the command line. I prefer Heroku (at the small end of the scale), because I don't want to spend precious resources on making deploys work or worrying about a crashed EC2 instance. On the other hand, when the project grows, those are solvable "first-world" problems. On the front end, I'll use libraries such as Backbone and tools in the Chrome debugger to make beautiful, responsive, resilient applications. I am fluent with HTML (or HAML) and CSS (or SASS). I like pairing with designers to implement visual and UX designs.

As an "Anchor," which is Pivotal's term for technical leader and process advocate, I am expected to not only code every day, but also help the client learn our process well enough that when the finish their engagement with us, they can do it on their own. I help product managers write stories and comb the backlog. I conduct interviews on behalf of the client.

As manager, I coach engineers to achieve the "next level" of performance, especially leadership skills, (most "pivots" are self-motivated technically). By the end of their first year, each one is capable of acting as a team leader, working closely with the client, designers, and other stake holders on a project. I work with my reports to identify and cultivate something (a goal) that is deeply personal to them. Then we come up with concrete objectives to the goal. This becomes a key metric during their annual review. We foster a culture of continuous feedback so corrections are small, and there are no surprises at our one-on-ones.
